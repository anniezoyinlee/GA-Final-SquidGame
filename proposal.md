## Project Description
Coffee.Tea.Mate 2.0 is an app for people to make friends in a coffee shop.
Other dating apps might have problems like 
- People only want to meet in bars/personal places
- People disappeared after chatting for a while
- Lazy to meet up, donâ€™t know where to meet
This app can fix these problems, use it in a coffee shop/tea house you will meet people already in the same space who also wants to make friends, and it will be a safe place to make friends with strangers.

It's a remake of my old project, the new feature includes:
Chat room 
QR Code access
Responsive layout
Original App: https://project3-mate.herokuapp.com/?Search=mark
