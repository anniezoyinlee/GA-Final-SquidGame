This app is a game center for some mini games. Game ideas are from Squid Game, a South Korean survival drama television series streaming on Netflix. This app is designed to have five games from the show: 
1. Red Light, Green Light
2. Dalgona Candy
3. Tug of War
4. Marbles
5. The Glass Stepping Stones

For now only Red Light, Green Light and Dalgona Candy are available to play.
